_(New in version 7.13.0)_

The [sentry_drift](https://pub.dev/packages/sentry_drift) package provides `Drift` support for database instrumentation. The source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/tree/main/drift). Note, that to capture transactions, you have to first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink>.

## Install

Add the `sentry_drift` dependency to install the Drift database instrumentation.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
sentry_flutter: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.flutter', '7.2.0') }}
sentry_drift: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.drift', '7.2.0') }}
```

## Configure

The `SentryQueryExecutor` needs to be injected into a Drift database instance:

```dart
import 'package:drift/native.dart';
import 'package:sentry_drift/sentry_drift.dart';

final executor = SentryQueryExecutor(
  () => NativeDatabase.memory(), // You can also provide your own DatabaseOpener
  databaseName: 'my_db_name',
);
final database = AppDatabase(executor); // AppDatabase is an example of the auto-generated database class by Drift.
```

After configuring via one of the above methods, every `CRUD` operation, including database transactions and batches, will be automatically instrumented and sent to Sentry.
